Allout files are a handy synoptic (or tree-like) representation of a document.  Such files were originally introduced as a GNU Emacs mode.  Vim offers tools and help for browsing or editing these Allout files.

Once installed, syntax colouring of Allout files should work in standard Vim.  Allout specific commands and mappings require a Python-enabled Vim.
